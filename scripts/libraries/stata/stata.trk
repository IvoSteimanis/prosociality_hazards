d first named variable is innermost on the display; that is, its
d categories vary fastest. catplot is a wrapper for graph hbar

d 'CIBAR': module to plot bar graphs and confidence intervals over groups

d  cibar plots bars and confidence intervals of the mean of a

d that resemble graphs created by graph bar varname, over(varname)
d asyvar,  adding confidence intervals to the bars. In order to do
d so, cibar uses Stata's twoway bar and twoway rcap. cibar shows

d table without much typing. estadd adds additional results to the
d e()-returns for one or several models previously fitted and

d 'OUTREG2': module to arrange regression outputs into an illustrative table
d 
d  outreg2 provides a fast and easy way to produce an illustrative
d table  of regression outputs. The regression outputs are produced
d piecemeal and are  difficult to compare without some type of
d rearrangement. outreg2  automates this process by concatenating
d the successive regression outputs in a  vertical format. The
d resulting table is saved to the disk in ASCII  format, which can
d be read by other programs. outreg2 thus facilitates  the
d convertion of regression outputs to a standard format suitable
d for  inclusion in a scholarly publication. The functionality of
d outreg2 is based on the earlier package outreg,  by John Luke
d Gallup. Unlike outreg, outreg2 is capable of writing LaTeX-format
d tables, as well as ASCII, MS Word and MS Excel.

d 'IETOOLKIT': module providing commands specially developed for Impact Evaluations
d 
d  ietookit provides a set of commands that address different
d aspects of data management and data analysis in relation to
d Impact Evaluations. The list of commands will be extended
d continuously, and suggestions on new commands are highly
d appreciated. Some of the commands are related to standardized
d practices developed at the World Bankâ€™s unit for Impact
d Evaluations (DIME) and might not apply to practices adopted at
d other institutions. For these commands, the corresponding help
d files provide justifications for the standardized practices
d applied. ieduplicates and iecompdup are useful tools to identify
d and correct for duplicates. iebaltab is a tool for multiple
d treatment arm balance tables. ieboilstart standardizes the
d boilerplate code at the top of all do-files. iegraph produces
d graphs based on common impact evaluation regression models. See
d https://github.com/worldbank/ietoolkit for more details.

d 'MYLABELS': module for axis labels or ticks on transformed scales or for daily dates
d 
d mylabels and myticks generate axis labels and ticks on
d transformed scales. Their use is best explained by example. You
d draw a graph and one axis is on a transformed square root scale.
d You wish the axis labels to show untransformed values. For some
d values this is easy; for example, ylabel(0 1 2 "4" 3 "9" 4 "16" 5
d "25") says use "4" as label for 2, and so forth. For other values
d and/or other transformations the conversion may be more difficult
d to do in your head. The idea behind mylabels is that you feed it
d the numeric labels you want shown and the transformation being
d used. It will then place the appropriate specification in a local
d macro which you name. You may then use that local macro as part
d of a later graphics command. The idea behind myticks is similar.
d  mydays displays a formatted list of specified days that lie
d within the range of a tsset daily date variable describing a time
d series and puts the numeric version of that list in a specified
d local macro. The result may be useful for specifying axis label
d or tick positions on graphs of time series. mydays requires Stata
d 9.0.
